My Day-4-Assignment
Why is timely delivery crucial in software project management, and how can project managers ensure deadlines are met?
Builds consumer confidence in the product due to developers reliability to do a project within the stipulated time. It also provides an edge in competition,a software can be adopted by the target marget before competing softwares have been introduced into  the market.Projects compeleted on time improves team morale.
Managers can ensure deadlines are met by making an plan that is achieveable within the stipulated time.This can be done through prioritization of tasks and clear approach to accomplishing the tasks using either agile or iterative method.Managers also come up with guidelines on risk management to avoid time wastage incase of a setback.To meet the deadlines each team member is accountable on their allocated tasks.
How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?
Cost control ensures that a project remains within stipulated finances without affecting the value of the project.This leads to resource optimization,risk mitigation and profit predicatbility.
Strategies to prevent budget overruns are:Accurate estimation of the expected expenditure to build a valuable software,agile budgeting through feature prioritization and increamental funding,resource optimization and risk mitigation plannning.
Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Agile has a high flexibility while waterfall has a low flexibility
Agile is increamental while waterfall is linear
Risks can be detected early in Agile due to its iterative nature while risks emerge late in waterfall
Agile method is suitable for collaboration while waterfall method is suitsble for organisations with hierachical structures.
Advantages of agile:Encourages stakeholder engagement,highly flexible and adaptable,focuses on quality due to its iterative nature
Disadvantages of agile:Unpredicatble timelines,resource intensive and may have documentation gaps.
Advantages of waterfall:Clear timelines,budget control,thorough documentation
Disadvantages of waterfall:Risks detected late,poor adaptability and lack of stakeholder input in the development process.
In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
Agile:
Suitable for developiing softwares with need for continous updates,for example a social media app Whatsapp
Suitable for experimental project,for example bulding AI
Suitable for projects with cross-functional teams
Waterfall:
Suitable for environments where software developments is highly regulated,for example medical device
Suitable for projects with short timelines and clear scope,for example a web page for a cafe menu
Suitable where the budget is fixed

What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
Clearly defining the criteria that a complete task should meet
Automating testing
Manual testing
Continuous integration\Continuous deployment
Code reviews
Performance and security testing
Monitoring and feedback loops
It is important to maintain high standards so as to satisfy the consumer needs,maintain brand reputation and developing a product that provides value for the investment spent in development.
How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
A clearly defined scope prevents an uncontrolled expansion of deliverables,budget overruns and stakeholder conflict.It contributes to adequate resource allocation,clear risk mitigation planning,clear deliverables and a quatifiable outcome.
WBS breaks down the project into small tasks in hierarchical format. It is useful since it facilitates task prioritization,task progress tracking,accountability,risk identification enabling early mitigation and cost and time estimation.
What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?
A detailed project schedule is useful for enabling teams to have a clear time visualization,adequate resource allocation,propeer risk mitigation strategies and stakeholder communication.
A Gantt chart can assist with visual clarity,team coordination,real time adjustments and dependency management.
What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience?
Awareness on medication induced cormobidities
Comorbidities caused by therapeutic drugs
Patient with chronic conditions often deteroriate with continued drug use instead of improving.This can lead to mortality due to clinical negligence during clinics or due to patients not identifying drug related comorbidities. 
How can clearly defining the problem help in developing a more effective software solution?
A clearly defined problem guides the design and architecture of the software,leads to resource optimization,improves testing and validation and enables early risk detection and mitigation.
How would you describe your software solution in a way that captures its essence without diving into technical details?
A software that helps inform the patient that what they are experiencing is not a result of their health condition but rather an adverse drug reaction and they should report it immediately and stop taking the medications.

What are the main features or functionalities that make your software stand out?
An easy to read library of adverse drug reactions of all drugs registered under FDA on your smart device.
Patient control on treatment progress
What data is available regarding the market size and growth potential for your software?
It is possible to order certain medications online and do medical consultation online therefore people are open to receiving information through their smart devices.
How can understanding market trends inform your softwareâ€™s positioning and development?
It enables a developer to position their product to the right market
It enables the developer to leverage industry shifts
It enables a developer to come up with an evolving software that is adaptable with the ever changing trends and shifting regulations
